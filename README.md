## Problem Statement:
Chat rooms have become a popular way to support a forum for n-way conversation or discussion among a set of people with interest in a common topic. Chat applications range from simple, text-based ones to entire virtual worlds with exotic graphics. In this project we have implemented a simple web-based chat client/server application

## Problem Description:
Email, newsgroup and messaging applications provide means for communication among people but these are one-way mechanisms and they do not provide an easy way to carry on a real-time conversation or discussion with people involved. Chat room extends the one-way messaging concept to accommodate multi-way communication among a set of people.
